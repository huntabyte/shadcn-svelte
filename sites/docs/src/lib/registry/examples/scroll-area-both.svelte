		Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving jokes all
		over the place: under the king's pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The king was
		furious, but he couldn't seem to stop Jokester. And then, one day, the people of the kingdom
		discovered that the jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but laugh.
		And once they started laughing, they couldn't stop.
