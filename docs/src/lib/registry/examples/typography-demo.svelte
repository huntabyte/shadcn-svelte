		Taxing Laughter: The Joke Tax Chronicles
	</h1>
	<p class="text-muted-foreground text-xl leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who spent all day lounging
		on his throne. One day, his advisors came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out
		of money.

		The King&apos;s Plan
	</h2>
	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with
		<a href="##" class="text-primary font-medium underline underline-offset-4">
			a brilliant plan
		</a>
		: he would tax the jokes in the kingdom.
	</p>
	<blockquote class="mt-6 border-s-2 ps-6 italic">
		&quot;After all,&quot; he said, &quot;everyone enjoys a good joke, so it&apos;s only fair
		that they should pay for the privilege.&quot;
	</blockquote>
	<h3 class="mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">The Joke Tax</h3>
	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		The king&apos;s subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but the king was
		firm:
	</p>
	<ul class="my-6 ms-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2">
		<li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>
		<li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>
		<li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a gloom. But there was
		one person who refused to let the king&apos;s foolishness get him down: a court jester named
		Jokester.
	</p>
	<h3 class="mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Jokester&apos;s Revolt</h3>
	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving jokes all
		over the place: under the king&apos;s pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The
		king was furious, but he couldn&apos;t seem to stop Jokester.
	</p>
	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes left by Jokester were
		so funny that they couldn&apos;t help but laugh. And once they started laughing, they
		couldn&apos;t stop.
	</p>
	<h3 class="mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
		The People&apos;s Rebellion
	</h3>
	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter, started to tell jokes and puns
		again, and soon the entire kingdom was in on the joke.
