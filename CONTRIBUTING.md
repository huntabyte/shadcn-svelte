## Submitting a Pull Request

We use pull requests to propose changes to the project. The process generally goes like this:

1. A user opens an issue to discuss a new feature or to report a bug
2. A maintainer reviews the issue and may label it as `status: needs owner`
3. The issues author can volunteer to work on the issue, or someone else can
4. A maintainer assigns the issue to whoeever volunteers to work on it
5. The issue owner submits a pull request to address/resolve the issue
6. A maintainer reviews the pull request and if no changes are needed, merges it into the main repository

**Note:** Do not submit a pull request until a relevant issue has been opened and assigned to you, otherwise, you may end up wasting time on work that may not be merged into the project.

To volunteer to solve someone else's issue, please leave a comment on the issue to let us know that you'd like to work on it, along with a brief description of how you plan to address the issue.
