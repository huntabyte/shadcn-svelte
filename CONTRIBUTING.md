## Ways to contribute

We welcome all kinds of contributions:

- **Feedback** - have suggestions or ideas? [Open a discussion](https://github.com/huntabyte/shadcn-svelte/discussions) to discuss it. Just note that this project is a port of [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui), meaning we won't be adding new components to this project unless they are added to `shadcn/ui` first.
- **Help & Support** - if you enjoy helping others, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/SRbSSrvXug) and help out in the `libs` -> `shadcn-support` channel, or answer questions asked in [Discussions](https://github.com/huntabyte/shadcn-svelte/discussions)
- **Bug reports** - please [open an issue](https://github.com/huntabyte/shadcn-svelte/issues/new) to report a bug.
- **Docs fixes** - spot a typo or broken link? Open a PR. If it's a larger change, please start a discussion first.
- **Code improvements** - For anything more involved than a quick fix, start a discussion first so we can align before you dive in.

## How to contribute

We try to keep the process simple to avoid wasted effort:

1. **Open an issue** for bugs
2. **Start a discussion** for feature ideas, improvements, or questions
3. A maintainer will review and tag it (e.g. help wanted, under review, etc.)
4. Want to work on something? Just comment on the thread or open a PR.

**Quick fix?** For typos or small tweaks, feel free to skip the discussion and just open a PR.
**Bigger change?** Open a discussion first so we can figure things out together.

## Questions

If you're looking to contribute and have questions about the process or the codebase in general, feel free to ask in the [Discord](https://hbyt.us/discord) in the `libs`->`shadcn-chat` channel!
