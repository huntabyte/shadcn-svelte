## Ways to contribute

This project is open to contributions from the community.

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- **Feedback**: We're always looking for feedback on the project. If you have any suggestions, ideas, please open an issue to discuss it. One thing that should be noted is that this project is a port of `shadcn/ui`, meaning we won't be adding new components to this project unless they are added to `shadcn/ui` first.
- **Support**: If you feel confident in your ability to help others with their questions, please join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/SRbSSrvXug) and help out in the `libs` -> `shadcn-support` channel, or answer questions asked in [Discussions](https://github.com/huntabyte/shadcn-svelte/discussions).
- **Documentation improvements**: See a typo or broken link? Or do you think the documentation could be improved in some other way? If it's a typo/broken link, feel free to open a PR. If the change would involve more than a few line changes, please open an issue to discuss it first before spending time on it.
- **Code optimizations**: If you see a way to improve the code, please open an issue to discuss it.

## How to contribute

This project operates using a process that makes maintaining the project less stressful, while also preventing wasted time and effort on contributions that may not be merged into the project.

Here's what the process looks like:

1. A user opens an issue to report a bug, request a new feature, or propose a change
2. A maintainer reviews the issue and assigns it a status label
   1. `needs owner` - the issue is ready to be worked on, but no one has volunteered to work on it yet. If you would like to work on the issue, please leave a comment on the issue to let us know along with a brief description of how you plan to address the issue (if it's not already clear from the issue description).
   2. `accepted` - the issue has been assigned to someone and they are working on a solution for it.
   3. `duplicate` - the issue is a duplicate of another issue. The issue will be closed and a link to the original issue will be provided.
   4. `blocked` - the issue is blocked by another issue either within this project or another.
   5. `revisions needed` - the issue requires additional information or reproduction details before it will be considered for implementation/fix.
   6. `under review` - further discussion is needed before a decision can be made on how to proceed with the issue.
3. The issue author can volunteer to work on the issue within the issue itself, or someone else can volunteer to work on it.
4. A maintainer assigns the issue to whoever volunteers to work on it and becomes the "owner" of the issue.
5. The issue owner submits a pull request to address/resolve the issue.
6. A maintainer reviews the pull request and if no revisions are needed, adds the changesets (if required) and merges it into the main repository.

**NOTE:** Do not submit a pull request for anything other than minor documentation/typo fixes without first opening an issue and having it assigned to you. We don't want you to waste time on something that may not be merged/accepted.

To volunteer to solve someone else's issue, please leave a comment on the issue to let us know that you'd like to work on it, along with a brief description of how you plan to address the issue (if it's not already clear from the issue description), and we'll assign the issue to you.
