### Why do I need to provide a reproduction?

This project is maintained by a very small team, and we simply don't have the bandwidth to investigate issues that we can't easily replicate. Reproductions enable us to fix issues faster and more efficiently. If you care about getting your issue resolved, providing a reproduction is the best way to do that.

### I've provided a reproduction - what happens now?

Once a reproduction is provided, we'll remove the `needs reproduction` label and review the issue to determine how to resolve it. If we can confirm it's a bug, we'll label it as such and prioritize it based on its severity.

If `needs reproduction` labeled issues don't receive any activity (e.g., a comment with a reproduction link), they'll be closed. Feel free to comment with a reproduction at any time and the issue will be reopened.

### How can I create a reproduction?

You can use [this template](https://shadcn-svelte.com/repro) to create a minimal reproduction. You can also link to a GitHub repository with the reproduction.

Please ensure that the reproduction is as **minimal** as possible. If there is a ton of custom logic in your reproduction, it is difficult to determine if the issue is with your code or with the library. The more minimal the reproduction, the more likely it is that we'll be able to assist.
