		Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who
		spent all day lounging on his throne. One day, his advisors came to him
		with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.

		The Joke Tax
	</h3>
	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		The king's subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but
		the king was firm:
	</p>
	<ul class="my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2">
		<li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>
		<li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>
		<li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a
		gloom. But there was one person who refused to let the king's
		foolishness get him down: a court jester named Jokester.

		Jokester's Revolt
	</h3>
	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and
		leaving jokes all over the place: under the king's pillow, in his soup,
		even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn't seem to
		stop Jokester.
	</p>
	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes
		left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but laugh. And
		once they started laughing, they couldn't stop.

	<h3 class="mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
		The People's Rebellion
	</h3>
	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter, started to
		tell jokes and puns again, and soon the entire kingdom was in on the
		joke.
