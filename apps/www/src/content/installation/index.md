## Imports

Unlike the original [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for React, where the full components can exist in a single file, components in this port are split into multiple files. This is because Svelte doesn't support defining multiple components in a single file, so utilizing the CLI to add components will be the optimal approach.

The CLI will create a folder for _each_ component, which will sometimes just contain a single Svelte file, and in other times, multiple files. Within each folder, there will be an `index.ts` file that exports the component(s), so you can import them from a single file.

For example, the Accordion component is split into four `.svelte` files:

- `Accordion.svelte`
- `AccordionContent.svelte`
- `AccordionItem.svelte`
- `AccordionTrigger.svelte`

They can then be imported from the `accordion/index.ts` file like so:

```ts
import * as Accordion from '$lib/components/ui/accordion"
// or
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionContent,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger
} from "$lib/components/ui/accordion"
```

Regardless of the import approach you take, the components will be tree-shaken by Rollup, so you don't have to worry about unused components being bundled into your app.

## TypeScript

This project and the components are written in TypeScript. We recommend using TypeScript for your project as well.

However, we provide a JavaScript version of the components as well. The JavaScript version is _only_ available via the [CLI](/docs/cli).

### Opt-out of TypeScript

To opt out of TypeScript, set the `typescript` flag to `false` in your `components.json` file.

```json {7} title="components.json"
{
  "style": "default",
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js",
    "css": "src/app/globals.css"
  },
  "typescript": false,
  "aliases": {
    "utils": "$lib/utils",
    "components": "$lib/components"
  }
}
```

To configure import aliases, you need to create a `jsconfig.json`:

```json {4} title="jsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "$lib/*": ["./src/lib/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## ESLint configuration

If you are using ESLint, some components may trigger false positives depending on your ESLint configuration. For example, you could end up with lint errors when components define `$$Props` to specify the type for `$$restProps` as `$$Props` is not directly used in the rest of the component.

To ignore these linting errors, you can modify your ESLint configuration.

One option is to add a `.eslintrc` file in the directory where you define your components, `$lib/components/ui` for example:

```json title="src/lib/components/ui/.eslintrc"
{
  "rules": {
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": [
      "warn",
      {
        "argsIgnorePattern": "^_",
        "varsIgnorePattern": "^\\\\$\\\\$(Props|Events|Slots|Generic)$"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The main benefit of adding an additional `.eslintrc` file just to `$lib/components/ui` is that you will not affect how ESLint functions for the rest of your project. Only your `shadcn-svelte` components will ignore these false positives.

If this is not important to you, then another option is to use a similar rule override in your global ESLint configuration file, usually `.eslintrc.cjs`. For inspiration, please refer to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/huntabyte/b73073a93a7a664f3cbad7c50376c9c9).
